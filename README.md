# individualitasComputatione_DK

This project was created as a part of a maturity paper. It is the code for a generative artwork based on L-Systems. The outcome is a plant like structure based on Facebook ID and current IP-Location data. It uses the p5.js library.

## How to use

Before running the code one must use their Facebook ID as the "nurtureSeed" variable in the sktech.js file. The Facebook ID can be found by accessing one's Facebook profile and searching for "profile_id" in the source code. 

This code was tested with the Atom text editor with the _atom live-server_ (https://atom.io/packages/atom-live-server)

For running the code one must click on the canvas, to generate a new iteration of the L-System sentence. Recommended are five clicks/five iterations. When 'd' is pressed the plant is drawn to the canvas.

Processing time can get up to 20'. 

This code is intended to to be experienced with. Change variables and colors to the artists liking.
